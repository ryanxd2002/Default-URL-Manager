# Default-URL-Manager

## Purpose
provides a way to customize urls for the search bar. 
maps a keyword you type to a url for easy access
e.x. 
1. map youtube -> https://www.youtube.com
2. type "go youtube" to open https://www.youtube.com

## Installation
1. download this repository
2. open chrome and go to chrome://extensions
3. in the top right corner, turn on developer mode
4. press "load unpacked"
5. select the file you downloaded from github
6. (optional) just to the right of the search bar, press the       'extensions' icon and pin this extension to the taskbar

## Usage
1. Set the keyword you want to use to search for a particular url in the "Keyword" section
2. Set the url you want
    - *Note: there is url autocomplete*
3. press add, this will add this keyword - url combination
5. type "go" + " " to activate custom url manager
6. type in the keyword and press Enter
4. press delete to remove

## Further development
1. Add extension mapping for chrome features i.e. chrome://history
    - currently url autocomplete maps this feature incorrectly
2. Write a more thorough README
